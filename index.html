        <h1>Welcome to Jiduo's World</h1>
        <p>
            I am Jiduo Chen, currently in my third year, majoring in Computer Science combined with Business. 
            Iâ€™m passionate about both technology and sports. Video games, especially esports competitions, 
            inspire me to think strategically, and playing basketball keeps me active and focused. 
            Through these interests, I have learned the importance of persistence, teamwork, and creative thinking.
