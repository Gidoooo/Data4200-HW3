        <h1>Jiduo Chen</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Jiduo Chen, a third-year student majoring in Computer Science combined with Business. 
            I am passionate about video games and basketball. I enjoy watching esports and sports events, especially the NBA, 
            because they inspire me and bring out my passion for competition. 
            Games and sports have taught me essential lessons about teamwork, strategy, and resilience, 
            and I try to apply these principles in my academic and personal life. 
            I look forward to sharing more about my journey and connecting with others who share similar interests.
